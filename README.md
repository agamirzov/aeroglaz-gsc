## Overview

A simple GCS app for DJI drones that enables execution of mapping missions.

Features:
* Advanced mission editor
* GeoJSON import / export
* Automatic mission execution
* Telemetry data presentation
* DJI simulator integration for testing

The app is tested on Phantom 4 V2 and Mavic Pro models but in theory any DJI drone that supports [mobile SDK](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/product_introduction.html#supported-products) should work. For robustness only USB remote connection is supported.
